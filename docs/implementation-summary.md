# Implementation Summary: Titles & Action Items

## Overview
Successfully implemented Approach 1 with signup title field and `pull_actions` tool functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Signup Title Field

**Files Modified:**
- `hooks/useAuthForm.ts` - Added title state and validation
- `app/(auth)/index.tsx` - Added title input field to signup form
- `lib/firebase/auth.ts` - Updated signUp and ensureUserProfile to accept title
- `services/chat.ts` - Updated createOrFindConversation to accept title parameter

**Flow:**
```
User signs up → Enters name + title → AI conversation created with title → Title stored in Firestore
```

### 2. Conversation Titles Display

**Files Modified:**
- `hooks/useConversation.ts` - Added title field to ConversationData type
- `hooks/useConversations.ts` - Updated to display title if available, fallback to participant names
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Updated to display conversation title in chat header

**Behavior:**
- If conversation has a title, display the title
- Otherwise, display participant names (existing behavior)

### 3. Pull Actions Tool

**Files Modified:**
- `services/openai.ts` - Added pull_actions tool definition and handler
- `services/n8n.ts` - Added pullActions function for n8n webhook integration
- `services/aiPrompts.ts` - Updated AI prompt to mention pull_actions tool

**Capabilities:**
- Detects keywords: "action items", "tasks", "todo", "what do I need to do"
- Can search by conversationId or participantName
- Personalizes responses (replaces IDs with names, "You" for current user)
- Calls n8n webhook at `{baseUrl}/pull-actions`

## How It Works

### User Flow Example:

1. **User signs up**: Enters name "John" and title "Finance"
2. **AI conversation created**: Conversation ID created with title "Finance"
3. **User chats with AI**: "Were there any action items for me from the finance conversation?"
4. **AI detects keywords**: "action items" + "finance conversation"
5. **Search**: Finds conversation with title "Finance" or participant named "Finance"
6. **n8n call**: POST to `/pull-actions` with conversationId
7. **Response**: Personalized action items list

### Data Flow:

```
[User Message] 
  ↓
[OpenAI detects keywords] 
  ↓
[Tool call: pull_actions({participantName: "finance"})]
  ↓
[Search conversation by name]
  ↓
[n8n webhook: /pull-actions]
  ↓
[n8n workflow: Extract actions → OpenAI]
  ↓
[Personalize: Replace IDs with names, "You" for current user]
  ↓
[Final AI response with actions]
```

## n8n Workflow Setup

### Required: Create "Pull Actions" Workflow

1. **Duplicate** the existing "Summarize" workflow
2. **Rename** to "Pull Actions"
3. **Modify OpenAI prompt**:
   ```
   Extract actionable items from this conversation. List specific tasks, 
   assignments, and follow-ups mentioned. Focus on what needs to be done, 
   by whom, and any deadlines.
   ```
4. **Update output field**: Change `summary` to `actions`
5. **Set webhook URL**: `{baseUrl}/pull-actions`
6. **Response format**: `[{actions: "...", userName: "..."}]`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up with name and title
- [ ] Verify AI conversation shows correct title
- [ ] Test action items extraction: "action items from finance conversation"
- [ ] Test search by participant name
- [ ] Verify personalization ("You" instead of user name)
- [ ] Test error handling (conversation not found)
- [ ] Verify n8n webhook integration

## Files Changed Summary

**Auth & Signup:**
- `hooks/useAuthForm.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Create n8n "Pull Actions" workflow (see above)
2. Test end-to-end flow
3. Monitor for any errors
4. Consider adding more tool types (decisions, next steps)

## Notes

- Titles are optional but validated during signup (min 2 characters)
- Conversation titles override participant name display
- Actions tool uses same personalization logic as summarize tool
- Webhook URL pattern: `{EXPO_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL}/pull-actions`
