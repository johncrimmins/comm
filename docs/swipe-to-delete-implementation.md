# Swipe-to-Delete Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented **swipe-to-delete** functionality for conversations and **removed card borders** to match the TalkTime design aesthetic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Card Borders ✅
**File**: `styles/screens/tabs.ts`

**Before**: Conversation cards had subtle borders  
**After**: Clean, borderless cards (matching TalkTime design)

```typescript
// BEFORE
conversationCard: {
  overflow: 'hidden',
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: Colors.dark.border,
}

// AFTER
conversationCard: {
  overflow: 'hidden',
}
```

### 2. Created SwipeableRow Component ✅
**File**: `components/conversation/SwipeableRow.tsx` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Uses `react-native-gesture-handler` (already installed)
- Red delete button with trash icon appears on swipe
- Smooth animated reveal
- Automatically closes after deletion
- Clean, minimal design

**Technical Details**:
- Width: 80px delete area
- Delete button: 44x44px circular red button
- Animation: Scale interpolation for smooth reveal
- Threshold: 40px swipe distance
- No overshoot (clean interaction)

### 3. Integrated Swipe-to-Delete ✅
**File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Wrapped each conversation in `SwipeableRow` component
- Added `handleDeleteConversation` function
- Uses Firestore `deleteDoc` to remove conversation
- AI conversation is NOT swipeable (protected)
- Wrapped screen in `GestureHandlerRootView` for gesture support

**Code Flow**:
```typescript
<SwipeableRow onDelete={() => handleDeleteConversation(item.id)}>
  <TouchableOpacity onPress={handleConversationPress}>
    {/* Conversation content */}
  </TouchableOpacity>
</SwipeableRow>
```

## User Experience

### Swipe Gesture:
1. User swipes left on any conversation
2. Red delete button slides in from right
3. Tap delete button → conversation removed
4. Automatic cleanup from Firestore

### Design:
- **Delete Button**: Red (#EF4444) circular button
- **Icon**: Trash emoji (🗑️) for universal recognition
- **Size**: 44x44px (proper touch target)
- **Position**: Right side, 20px padding
- **Animation**: Smooth scale reveal

### Protection:
- **AI Conversation**: Cannot be deleted (swipe disabled)
- **Regular Conversations**: Fully deletable
- **No Confirmation**: Direct delete (can add confirmation later if needed)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
```
components/conversation/SwipeableRow.tsx  # New swipeable component
```

### Modified:
```
app/(tabs)/index.tsx                      # Added swipe integration
styles/screens/tabs.ts                    # Removed borders
```

## Technical Implementation

### Gesture Handler:
```typescript
import { Swipeable } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

### Firestore Deletion:
```typescript
const handleDeleteConversation = async (conversationId: string) => {
  const conversationRef = doc(db, 'conversations', conversationId);
  await deleteDoc(conversationRef);
};
```

### Animation:
```typescript
const scale = progress.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 1],
  outputRange: [0, 1],
  extrapolate: 'clamp',
});
```

## Design Principles Applied

### TalkTime-Inspired:
✅ **Borderless cards** - Clean, modern aesthetic
