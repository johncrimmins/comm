# Approaches for Group Chat Presence Indicators

## 1. Count Format: "3 online · 5 members"
**Simple and clear**
- Shows online count + total members
- Example: "3 online · 5 members"
- Easy to implement - just count online participants
- Works well in limited header space

**Implementation:**
- Return count string instead of "online"/"offline"
- Listen to all participants' presence
- Count how many are online

---

## 2. Percentage Format: "60% online"
**Concise metric**
- Shows percentage of online members
- Example: "60% online" (3 out of 5)
- Clean and space-efficient
- Quick mental calculation for engagement

**Implementation:**
- Calculate online count ÷ total members
- Round to percentage
- Display with "% online" suffix

---

## 3. Names Format: "Alice, Bob online"
**Personal and specific**
- Shows names of online members
- Example: "Alice, Bob online" or "Alice + 2 more online"
- Very informative for small groups
- Truncates with "+X more" for larger groups

**Implementation:**
- Fetch user names for online participants
- Join with commas, truncate after 2-3 names
- Add "+X more" suffix if needed

---

## 4. Badge Indicators on Avatars
**Visual and detailed**
- Show green indicators on member avatars
- Display all members with online status badges
- Most informative but requires layout changes
- Good for member list or expanded view

**Implementation:**
- Render participant avatars with status badges
- Overlay green dots on online users
- Requires more UI space

---

## 5. Hybrid: Count + Sample Names
**Balanced approach**
- Shows count + first 1-2 names
- Example: "3 online (Alice, Bob)" or "Alice + 2 more online"
- Good compromise between detail and brevity
- Works well in header without being too long

**Implementation:**
- Count online members
- Show first name or two
- Fall back to "+X more" format
