# Progress

## What Works
- Project compiles with Expo SDK 54 configuration.
- File‑based routing is scaffolded for auth, tabs, new conversation, and chat.
- Theming primitives and UI components exist for rapid composition.

## What’s Left To Build
- Epic 1: Messaging Core (A→B real-time, statuses, local-first writes, listeners).
- Epic 2: Offline Persistence (restart-safe, pagination, robust outbox).
- Epic 3: Reconnect Sync (flush queue, idempotent writes, listener reattach).
- Epic 4: Lifecycle (bg/fg), presence continuity, listener hygiene.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank initialized; PRD authored. Starting Epic 1 implementation next.

## Known Issues
- Tech context reflects current code; future-state details from PRD are deferred until each epic completes.
