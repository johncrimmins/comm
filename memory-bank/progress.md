# Progress

## What Works
- Firebase authentication and user profiles
- Real-time messaging via Firestore listeners
- Message delivery states (sent/delivered/read) working with arrays
- Display names and avatars in chat messages
- Group chat support (3+ users)
- Conversation list with real-time updates
- Read receipts when opening chat
- Online/offline presence indicators (via lastSeen timestamp)
- Group chat presence showing online count and total members
- Presence updates on app foreground/background
- Typing indicators showing "typing..." in chat header
- Auto-clear typing after 3 seconds of inactivity
- Foreground notifications for new messages in other conversations (expo-notifications)
- Cross-platform support: iOS, Android, and Web
- Web keyboard input working properly
- Safe area handling on iOS with proper edge configuration
- Reusable ChatInput component used across screens
- Consistent theming with GlassCard components
- Long-press text transformations: Multiple options (Concise, Professionalize, Technicalize) via dynamic popover
- Transformation service pattern: Centralized configuration in services/messageTransformations.ts
- Generic OpenAI API: Refactored to accept any system prompt for scalable transformations
- Dynamic button rendering: Stacked transformation buttons with proper styling
- Gesture handler patterns: LongPressGestureHandler with state management to prevent unintended actions
- Popover UI with smooth animations (Reanimated spring animations)
- Tap-outside-to-dismiss functionality for popovers
- AI conversation feature: Sticky "Chat with Comms (AI)" conversation with OpenAI integration
- AI chat service: Separate aiChat service wrapping chat and OpenAI APIs
- AI conversation auto-creation: Created during user signup with participantIds [userId, 'ai-assistant']
- AI message handling: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate AI responses and stores them in Firestore

## What's Left To Build
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Improved offline support beyond Firestore cache
- Fix iPhone input area visibility issues
- Future: Multiple AI agent types (Summarize, Detect Actions, Track Decisions, Scheduler)

## Current Status
- Firestore-first architecture working
- MVP messaging core complete with delivery states
- Presence and typing indicators implemented and working
- Foreground notifications implemented with logging
- Cross-platform UI working with Platform-specific optimizations
- Component refactoring complete with shared ChatInput component
- OpenAI integration added for enhanced message editing features
- Gesture handling patterns established for future enhancements
- Transformation architecture established with scalable design pattern
- Dynamic UI rendering patterns implemented for reusable components
- AI conversation feature fully implemented with sticky header and OpenAI integration
- AI chat service pattern established for future multi-agent support

## Known Issues
- No offline persistence beyond Firestore's offline cache
- Presence updates may not work reliably in all app states
- iPhone input area visibility needs investigation
- Web is fully functional, iOS/Android generally working well
