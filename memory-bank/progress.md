# Progress

## What Works
- Firebase authentication and user profiles
- Real-time messaging via Firestore listeners
- Message delivery states (sent/delivered/read) working with arrays
- Display names and avatars in chat messages
- Group chat support (3+ users)
- Conversation list with real-time updates
- Read receipts when opening chat
- Online/offline presence indicators (via lastSeen timestamp)
- Group chat presence showing online count and total members
- Presence updates on app foreground/background
- Typing indicators showing "typing..." in chat header
- Auto-clear typing after 3 seconds of inactivity
- Foreground notifications for new messages in other conversations (expo-notifications)
- Cross-platform support: iOS, Android, and Web
- Web keyboard input working properly
- Safe area handling on iOS with proper edge configuration
- Reusable ChatInput component used across screens
- Consistent theming with GlassCard components
- Long-press text transformations: Multiple options (Concise, Professionalize, Technicalize) via dynamic popover
- Transformation service pattern: Centralized configuration in services/messageTransformations.ts
- Generic OpenAI API: Refactored to accept any system prompt for scalable transformations
- Dynamic button rendering: Stacked transformation buttons with proper styling
- Gesture handler patterns: LongPressGestureHandler with state management to prevent unintended actions
- Popover UI with smooth animations (Reanimated spring animations)
- Tap-outside-to-dismiss functionality for popovers
- AI conversation feature: Sticky "Chat with Comms (AI)" conversation with OpenAI integration
- AI chat service: Separate aiChat service wrapping chat and OpenAI APIs
- AI conversation auto-creation: Created during user signup with participantIds [userId, 'ai-assistant']
- AI message handling: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate AI responses and stores them in Firestore
- RAG integration: OpenAI tool calling for conversation summarization via n8n webhooks
- n8n service: Webhook integration for calling RAG pipelines from client
- Conversation summarization: AI detects "summary" keywords and calls n8n to summarize conversations
- Tool calling flow: OpenAI → tool call → n8n webhook → Firebase fetch → summary → OpenAI → final response
- Code refactoring: Extracted message status logic to utils/messageStatus.ts (reduced complexity by 13 lines)
- Code refactoring: Extracted conversation search logic to utils/conversationHelpers.ts (reduced complexity by 69 lines)
- Architecture documentation: Comprehensive data flow mapping in docs/ai-chat-architecture-analysis.md
- Type safety: TypeScript interfaces defined in types/api.ts for all API responses
- Utility functions: Pure functions extracted for better testability and reusability

## What's Left To Build
- Add sender names to message documents in Firestore
- Additional tool calls (action items, decisions, next steps)
- Store summaries in Firestore for future retrieval
- Future: Proactive conversation summaries stored in Firebase (automatic summarization)
- Future: Multiple AI agent types (Detect Actions, Track Decisions, Scheduler)
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Improved offline support beyond Firestore cache
- Fix iPhone input area visibility issues

## Current Status
- Firestore-first architecture working
- MVP messaging core complete with delivery states
- Presence and typing indicators implemented and working
- Foreground notifications implemented with logging
- Cross-platform UI working with Platform-specific optimizations
- Component refactoring complete with shared ChatInput component
- OpenAI integration added for enhanced message editing features
- Gesture handling patterns established for future enhancements
- Transformation architecture established with scalable design pattern
- Dynamic UI rendering patterns implemented for reusable components
- AI conversation feature fully implemented with sticky header and OpenAI integration
- AI chat service pattern established for future multi-agent support
- RAG integration complete: Conversation summarization working via n8n webhooks
- OpenAI tool calling implemented for extendable AI capabilities
- Code quality improved: Reduced code complexity by 82 lines through utility extraction
- Architecture documented: Complete data flow mapping and file responsibilities documented
- Type safety enhanced: TypeScript interfaces defined for all external API responses
- Separation of concerns: Pure utility functions extracted for message status and conversation search

## Known Issues
- No offline persistence beyond Firestore's offline cache
- Presence updates may not work reliably in all app states
- iPhone input area visibility needs investigation
- Web is fully functional, iOS/Android generally working well
